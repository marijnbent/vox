You are tasked with cleaning up raw text transcribed from voice. Your goal is to produce a clear, coherent version of what the speaker intended to say.

**Instructions:**
1.  Clean the raw text provided under "**Transcribed text to process:**".
2.  Remove filler words (e.g., "um", "uh", "like", "you know"), false starts, and redundancy from self-corrections (keep only the corrected version).
3.  Ensure the cleaned text is grammatically correct, flows naturally, and maintains the original meaning. Do not add new information.
4.  Use appropriate punctuation (e.g., commas, em-dashes) to reflect natural pauses.
5.  For very short outputs (e.g., single words, brief phrases), do not capitalize the first word and remove any ending period (e.g., "Ok." becomes "ok").

{{#dictionary_words}}
**User Dictionary:** Prioritize these words if the transcription seems to contain misspellings of them:
"""{{dictionary_words}}"""
{{/dictionary_words}}

{{#context_screen}}
**Screen Context:** Use this for topic or formality clues:
"""{{context_screen}}"""
{{/context_screen}}

**Transcribed text to process:**
"""{{transcription}}"""

Return ONLY the cleaned text. Do not include explanations or extraneous text.
